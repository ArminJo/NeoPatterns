 Extensions are:
 *  **Accelerator MPU6050 input**.
 *  Classes for Car, Bridge, Ramp and Loop with **natural gravity**.
 *  **Light effects** by NeoPattern library.
 *  **Tone generation without dropouts** by use of hardware timer output.
 *  Winner melody by PlayRTTTL library.
 *  Compensation for blocked millis() timer during draw.
 *  Checks for RAM availability.
 *  Overlapping of cars is handled by using addPixelColor() for drawing.
 *  Dynamic activation of up to 4 cars.
