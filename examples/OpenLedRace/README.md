**Extended version** of the OpenLedRace ["version Basic for PCB Rome Edition. 2 Player, without Boxes Track"](https://gitlab.com/open-led-race/olr-arduino).<br/>
Available as [OpenLedRace example](https://github.com/ArminJo/NeoPatterns/tree/master/examples/OpenLedRace) in the [NeoPatterns library](https://github.com/ArminJo/NeoPatterns).

# Extensions to standard version
 *  **Input from MPU6050 Accelerometer**.
 *  Classes for Car, Bridge, Ramp and Loop with **natural gravity**.
 *  **Light effects** by NeoPattern library.
 *  **Tone generation without dropouts** by use of hardware timer output.
 *  2004 **LCD** for instructions and leap counter.
 *  Input feedback by an 8 pixel Neopixel bar.
 *  Winner melody by PlayRTTTL library.
 *  Compensation for blocked millis() timer during draw.
 *  Checks for RAM availability.
 *  Overlapping of cars is handled by using addPixelColor() for drawing.
 *  **Development mode**, where Gravity, Friction and Drag can be set by potentiomenters.

 <br/>

# Principle of operation
With every button press or every acceleration of the dumbbells you **add a fixed amount of energy to the "car"**.<br/>
This energy is used to **increase speed**.

Formula is: **NewSpeed = sqrt((OldSpeed * OldSpeed) + AdditionalEnergy)**

On the other hand, **energy is consumed by friction and drag**.<br/>
Gravity also increases or decreases the car as in real life.

Formula is: **NewSpeed = OldSpeed + Gravity + Friction + (OldSpeed * Drag)**

# Compile with the Arduino IDE
Download and extract the repository. In the Arduino IDE open the sketch with File -> Open... and select the OpenledRace folder.<br/>
You need to install *Adafruit NeoPixel* library under "Tools -> Manage Libraries..." or "Ctrl+Shift+I" -> use "neoPixel" as filter string.<br/>
You also need to install *NeoPatterns* and *PlayRtttl* library under "Tools -> Manage Libraries..." or "Ctrl+Shift+I"

# BOM
### Required
- Breadboard
- Jumper wire
- Pin header to connect cables to breadboard
- Arduino Nano
- WS2812 strip 5m 60 IP30 - 60 pixel per meter
- 10 kOhm resistor for WS2812 strip data input
- 2 Arcade pushuttons + 2x2 meter 2-wire cable
- 2004 LCD with serial I2C interface adapter
- Speaker > 32 ohm
- 4.7 uF capacitor for speaker
- Power supply - e.g. a 18650 battery + holder

### Recommended
